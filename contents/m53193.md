<div data-type="abstract">
For many students, this course is a terminal course. A derivative of Precalculus, College Algebra and Trigonometry was developed for a broad range of first- and second- year college students. Since algebra and trigonometry courses vary from one institution to the next we’ve developed a comprehensive book that covers more ground than an instructor could likely cover in a typical one- or two-semester course; but instructors should find, almost without fail, that the topics they wish to include in their syllabus are covered in the text.
</div>

Welcome to *Algebra and Trigonometry*, an OpenStax College resource. This textbook has been created with several goals in mind: accessibility, customization, and student engagement—all while encouraging students toward high levels of academic scholarship. Instructors and students alike will find that this textbook offers a strong foundation in algebra and trigonometry in an accessible format.

# About *Algebra and Trigonometry*   {#eip-626}

Written and reviewed by a team of highly experienced instructors, *Algebra and Trigonometry* provides a comprehensive and multi-layered exploration of algebraic principles. The text is suitable for a typical introductory algebra course, and was developed to be used flexibly. While the breadth of topics may go beyond what an instructor would cover, the modular approach and the richness of content ensures that the book meets the needs of a variety of programs.

*Algebra and Trigonometry* guides and supports students with differing levels of preparation and experience with mathematics. Ideas are presented as clearly as possible, and progress to more complex understandings with considerable reinforcement along the way. A wealth of examples – usually several dozen per chapter – offer detailed, conceptual explanations, in order to build in students a strong, cumulative foundation in the material before asking them to apply what they’ve learned.

# Coverage and Scope   {#eip-250}

In determining the concepts, skills, and topics to cover, we engaged dozens of highly experienced instructors with a range of student audiences. The resulting scope and sequence proceeds logically while allowing for a significant amount of flexibility in instruction.

Chapters 1 and 2 provide both a review and foundation for study of Functions that begins in Chapter 3. The authors recognize that while some institutions may find this material a prerequisite, other institutions have told us that they have a cohort that need the prerequisite skills built into the course. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1168983371474"><span data-type="item">Chapter 1: Prerequisites</span> <span data-type="item">Chapter 2: Equations and Inequalities</span></span>

# Development Overview   {#eip-350}

Openstax *Algebra and Trigonometry* is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, editors, and instructors whose collective passion for this project has resulted in a text that is remarkably unified in purpose and voice. Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors.

The collective experience of our author team allowed us to pinpoint the subtopics, exceptions, and individual connections that give students the most trouble. And so the textbook is replete with well-designed features and highlights, which help students overcome these barriers. As the students read and practice, they are coached in methods of thinking through problems and internalizing mathematical processes.

For example, narrative text is often followed with the “How To” feature, which summarizes the presentation into a series of distinct steps. This approach addresses varying learning styles, and models for students an important learning skill for future studies. Furthermore, the extensive graphical representations immediately connect concepts with visuals.

# Accuracy of the Content   {#eip-42}

We understand that precision and accuracy are imperatives in mathematics, and undertook a dedicated accuracy program led by experienced faculty.

1.  Each chapter’s manuscript underwent rounds of review and revision by a panel of active instructors.
2.  Then, prior to publication, a separate team of experts checked all text, examples, and graphics for mathematical accuracy; multiple reviewers were assigned to each chapter to minimize the chances of any error escaping notice.
3.  A third team of experts was responsible for the accuracy of the Answer Key, dutifully re-working every solution to eradicate any lingering errors. Finally, the editorial team conducted a multi-round post-production review to ensure the integrity of the content in its final form.
{: data-number-style="arabic"}

The Solutions Manual, which was written and developed after the Student Edition, has also been rigorously checked for accuracy following a process similar to that described above. Incidentally, the act of writing out solutions step-by-step served as yet another round of validation for the Answer Key in the back of the Student Edition. In spite of the efforts described above, we acknowledge the possibility that—as with any textbook—some errata may have been missed. We encourage users to report errors via our [Errata][1] page.

# Pedagogical Foundations and Features   {#eip-563}

## Learning Objectives   {#eip-61}

Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section, and are the focal point of every instructional element

## Narrative text   {#eip-719}

Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples. Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1166658637533"><span data-type="item">Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined</span> <span data-type="item">Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</span> <span data-type="item">Key equations, formulas, theorems, identities, etc. are assigned a number, which appears near the right margin. Occasionally the text may refer back to an equation or formula by its number. </span></span>

## Examples   {#eip-802}

Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, which demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. The multiple Examples model different approaches to the same type of problem, or introduce similar problems of increasing complexity.

All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. The question clearly lays out a mathematical problem to solve. The Solution walks through the steps, usually providing context for the approach—in other words, why the instructor is solving the problem in a specific manner. Finally, the Analysis (for select examples) reflects on the broader implications of the Solution just shown. Examples are followed by a “Try It,” question, as explained below.

## Figures   {#eip-236}

Openstax *Algebra and Trigonometry* contains figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

<span data-type="media" id="preface01" data-alt="Example figure"> ![Example figure](../resources/CNX_CAT_Figure_Preface_01.jpg) </span>## Supporting Features   {#eip-22}

Four unobtrusive but important features, each marked by a distinctive icon, contribute to and check understanding.

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1170823342101" data-alt="how-to"> ![how-to](../resources/how-to.png) </span> A “How To” is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1171996044388" data-alt="try-it"> ![try-it](../resources/try-it.png) </span>A “Try It” exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem. In the Web View version of the text, students can click an Answer link directly below the question to check their understanding. In the PDF, answers to the Try-It exercises are located in the Answer Key.

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1172646370884" data-alt="QA"> ![QA](../resources/QA.png) </span>A Q&amp;A may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.

<span data-type="media" id="eip-id1172406565880" data-alt="media"> ![media](../resources/media.png) </span>The “Media” icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section.

Disclaimer: While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany Openstax *Algebra and Trigonometry*. We are deeply grateful to James Sousa for compiling his incredibly robust and excellent library of video tutorials, which he has made available to the public under a CC-BY-SA license at http://mathispower4u.yolasite.com/. Most or all of the videos to which we link in our “Media” feature (plus many more) are found in the Algebra 2 and Trigonometry video libraries at the above site.

## Section Exercises   {#eip-166}

Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice. With over 6300 exercises across the 13 chapters, instructors should have plenty to choose from<span data-type="footnote" id="eip-id1167449809193">6,367 total exercises. Includes Chapter Reviews and Practice Tests.</span>.

Section Exercises are organized by question type, and generally appear in the following order: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id8611023"><span data-type="item">**Verbal** questions assess conceptual understanding of key terms and concepts.</span> <span data-type="item">**Algebraic** problems require students to apply algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the section.</span> <span data-type="item">**Graphical** problems assess students’ ability to interpret or produce a graph.</span> <span data-type="item">**Numeric** problems require the student perform calculations or computations.</span> <span data-type="item">**Technology** problems encourage exploration through use of a graphing utility, either to visualize or verify algebraic results or to solve problems via an alternative to the methods demonstrated in the section.</span> <span data-type="item">**Extensions** pose problems more challenging than the Examples demonstrated in the section. They require students to synthesize multiple learning objectives or apply critical thinking to solve complex problems.</span> <span data-type="item">**Real-World Applications** present realistic problem scenarios from fields such as physics, geology, biology, finance, and the social sciences.</span></span>

## Chapter Review Features   {#eip-82}

Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that students can use to prepare for exams. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1170356513666"><span data-type="item">**Key Terms** provides a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter. </span> <span data-type="item">**Key Equations** presents a compilation of formulas, theorems, and standard-form equations. </span> <span data-type="item">**Key Concepts** summarizes the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant Example(s) in case students need to review.</span> <span data-type="item">**Chapter Review Exercises** include 40-80 practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each section.</span> <span data-type="item">**Practice Test** includes 25-50 problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter. Note that the practice test is not organized by section, and may be more heavily weighted toward cumulative objectives as opposed to the foundational objectives covered in the opening sections. </span> <span data-type="item">**Answer Key** includes the answers to all Try It exercises and every other exercise from the Section Exercises, Chapter Review Exercises, and Practice Test.</span></span>
